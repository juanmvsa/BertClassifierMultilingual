# Bert Classifier Multilingual 

This repository contains a notebook with code that performs classification of tweets in five classes.  

Also, a visualization for one of the predictions done by the Bert classifier is included. This is based on the LIME algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938).
