# Bert Classifier Multilingual 

This repository contains a notebook with code for performing the classification of tweets in Spanish (or any multiligual corpus) in five classes.  Also, a 
visualization for the predictions done by the Bert classifier is included. This is based on LIME (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938).
